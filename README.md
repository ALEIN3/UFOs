# UFOs
# Overview of Project
We are helping a customer build an app that provides data about UFO sightings. The customer wants to provide the users with more in-depth analysis by allowing them to filter for multiple criteria simultaneously. 
I will build the app to provide data like city, state, country, and shape, with the option to filter based on one or more criteria options.

## Softwares: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, BootStrap

Data Sources: Click here to view the [Data](https://github.com/ALEIN3/UFOs/blob/main/Static/JavaScript/data.js)

# Results

## How to navigate the page

You can find this Index in the up left corner of the screen.
You will be able to refresh the page and clean other filters by clicking this button.

### How to filter the data to get the desired results:
The user will be able to filter the data based on multiple criteria, and all the filter parameters can be entered simultaneously.:
•	Event date
•	City
•	State
•	Country
•	Shape

#### Filtering by event date

When the user enters the desired date, the page will filter the available data to show the entered values' results.

# Summary
Like every project in the world, we always have something that makes it better, so I will mention one drawback of this webpage and two other recommendations that we can add to improve the users’ experience.
•	As a drawback, we can see that we don’t explain the limitations of the data included in the study, the name of the cities, the included dates, and how many countries are involved in the available data….etc. And that will make the experience time-consuming for users by trying many options until they find valid data points.
•	As an improvement, we can add a list to show information about the available data on this webpage so the users can choose from the available options to save them valuable time trying every possible option.
•	As an improvement, we can provide a link for each sighting to guide users to the data source, so we save them time searching the internet for more information.
